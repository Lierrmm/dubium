Dubium works both in the browser and with node.

For browser use, either host the dubium.js file yourself (located in the `dist/` directory) or use a CDN (and, yes, it's free):

You can use either:

**jsDelivr:**
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dubium@0.0.7/dist/dubium.min.js"></script>
```

**unpckg:**
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/dubium@0.0.7/dist/dubium.min.js"></script>
````

As for NodeJS, it can be included like so:

```javascript
const dubium = require("dubium");
```
